            <h2>International Collaboration</h2>
            <p>Taking part in a conversation with Daniel Fisher, Werner SchÃ¼tze, and Jolian about recovery, empathy, and subjectivity in mental health care was a transformative experience.</p>
            <p>This wasn't an expert panel. It was a dialogue among people carrying their own stories. Daniel â€“ a psychiatrist with lived experience of psychosis, Werner â€“ a doctor learning from peer supporters, Jolian â€“ someone from the UK who has devoted her life to the empowerment movement. And me â€“ from Poland, with my own path, history, and a body that remembers institutional coldness.</p>
            <blockquote>"Recovery is not a medical process. It's a relationship, a community, a decision that someone deserves to be heard before they are judged." â€“ from a conversation with Daniel Fisher</blockquote>
            <p>I believe true change in psychiatry won't happen without those who've walked through fire. Only they â€“ only we â€“ can show where it truly hurts. This conversation proved that it's possible to build an alliance between lived experience, knowledge, and deep empathy.</p>
